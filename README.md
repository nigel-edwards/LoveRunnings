# LoveRunnings

## First project from **CodeInstitute**

Iâ€™ve learned how HTML and CSS work together to produce appealing, responsive websites.


Project description: 
Project LoveRunning is fully functioning website coded in pure HTML and CSS code, with help of GitPod. 

It's a static website which contains 3 pages - Home, Gallery and Sign up. Idea of website is to present Running club in Dublin, show us benefits of running and places where the club meets. Within a website, we have club social media links and gallery from previous meetings. Last but not least, a new user can sign up to running club with his name and e-mail.

Website is responsive and usable with tablet or smartphone.
